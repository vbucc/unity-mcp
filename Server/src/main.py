This server provides tools to interact with the Unity Game Engine Editor.

{custom_tools_note}

Targeting Unity instances:
- Use the resource mcpforunity://instances to list active Unity sessions (Name@hash).
- When multiple instances are connected, call set_active_instance with the exact Name@hash before using tools/resources to pin routing for the whole session. The server will error if multiple are connected and no active instance is set.
- Alternatively, pass unity_instance as a parameter on any individual tool call to route just that call (e.g. unity_instance="MyGame@abc123", unity_instance="abc" for a hash prefix). This does not change the session default.

Important Workflows:

Resources vs Tools:
- Use RESOURCES to read editor state (mcpforunity://editor/state, mcpforunity://project/info, mcpforunity://project/tags, mcpforunity://tests, etc)
- Use TOOLS to perform actions and mutations (manage_editor for play mode control, tag/layer management, etc)
- Always check related resources before modifying the engine state with tools

Reading resources (read this before using ANY resource named below):
- Resources are addressed by URI, never by name. A resource's name and URI are NOT interchangeable: names use underscores (e.g. editor_state) while URIs use slashes (e.g. mcpforunity://editor/state). Do NOT build a URI by swapping separators in the name — you will 404.
- These instructions always spell resources as full mcpforunity:// URIs — read one exactly as written. If you only have a name (from resources/list or another tool's output), look its URI up in resources/list rather than guessing it.
- Resource payloads are wrapped: the content lives under a top-level `data` object, so field paths are `data.<section>.<field>` (e.g. `data.advice.ready_for_tools`), not bare top-level fields.

Script Management:
- After creating or modifying scripts (by your own tools or the `manage_script` tool) use `read_console` to check for compilation errors before proceeding
- Only after successful compilation can new components/types be used
- You can poll mcpforunity://editor/state and read `data.compilation.is_compiling` to check if the domain reload is complete, or `data.advice.ready_for_tools` for overall readiness

Scene Setup:
- Always include a Camera and main Light (Directional Light) in new scenes
- Create prefabs with `manage_asset` for reusable GameObjects
- Use `manage_scene` to load, save, and query scene information

Path Conventions:
- Unless specified otherwise, all paths are relative to the project's `Assets/` folder
- Use forward slashes (/) in paths for cross-platform compatibility

Console Monitoring:
- Check `read_console` regularly to catch errors, warnings, and compilation status
- Filter by log type (Error, Warning, Log) to focus on specific issues

Menu Items:
- Use `execute_menu_item` when you have read the mcpforunity://menu-items resource
- This lets you interact with Unity's menu system and third-party tools

Before Writing C# Scripts:
- Check if an existing MCP tool can accomplish the task before writing Editor scripts.
- Call manage_tools(action="list_groups") to see available tool groups.
- If the task involves animation, VFX, UI Toolkit, testing, profiling, or ProBuilder, activate that group first.
- Prefer execute_code (scripting_ext group) over writing .cs files when no dedicated tool exists.

Extended Tool Groups:
- Only core tools are visible by default. Additional capabilities live in disabled groups.
- Use `manage_tools(action="list_groups")` to see all groups, then `manage_tools(action="activate", group="<name>")` to enable.
- Available groups:
  - docs: Unity API reflection (unity_reflect) & official documentation lookup (unity_docs). Activate before writing C# code.
  - scripting_ext: execute_code (run arbitrary C# in-editor without creating files) and manage_scriptable_object (create/modify SOs with GUID/path refs).
  - vfx: ParticleSystem, VisualEffect (VFX Graph), LineRenderer, TrailRenderer — create, configure, and control.
  - animation: Animator runtime control, AnimatorController editing (states, transitions, blend trees, parameters), AnimationClip creation & keyframing.
  - ui: UI Toolkit — create/modify UXML, USS, UIDocument, PanelSettings, visual tree queries.
  - testing: Unity Test Runner — run EditMode/PlayMode tests, async polling.
  - probuilder: ProBuilder 3D modeling — mesh creation, extrusion, beveling, vertex ops, UV/materials.
  - auditor: Project Auditor static analysis — code, assets, shaders, settings (Unity 6.4+).
  - profiling: Unity Profiler — CPU hotspots, memory snapshots, frame time, counters, Frame Debugger.
- When a task involves any of these domains, activate the relevant group first.

Unity API Verification (requires 'docs' tool group):
- When the 'docs' tool group is active, use `unity_reflect` and `unity_docs` to verify Unity API details before answering questions or writing C# code. LLM training data frequently contains incorrect, outdated, or hallucinated Unity APIs.
- BEFORE answering Unity API questions: search the project's assets (`manage_asset`) and reflect the API (`unity_reflect`) to verify. Do NOT rely on training data alone.
- Common hallucination areas: shaders and materials (always search assets for actual shader names), package-specific APIs (Input System, Cinemachine, ProBuilder, NavMesh, URP/HDRP), and APIs that changed between Unity versions.
- Workflow: `unity_reflect search` → `unity_reflect get_type` → `unity_reflect get_member` → `unity_docs get_doc` (if you need examples/caveats).
- For shader/material questions: use `manage_asset(action="search", filter_type="Shader")` to find actual shaders in the project before recommending one.

Payload sizing & paging (important):
- Many Unity queries can return very large JSON. Prefer **paged + summary-first** calls.
- `manage_scene(action="get_hierarchy")`:
  - Use `page_size` + `cursor` and follow `next_cursor` until null.
  - `page_size` is **items per page**; recommended starting point: **50**.
- `manage_gameobject(action="get_components")`:
  - Start with `include_properties=false` (metadata-only) and small `page_size` (e.g. **10-25**).
  - Only request `include_properties=true` when needed; keep `page_size` small (e.g. **3-10**) to bound payloads.
- `manage_asset(action="search")`:
  - Use paging (`page_size`, `page_number`) and keep `page_size` modest (e.g. **25-50**) to avoid token-heavy responses.
  - Keep `generate_preview=false` unless you explicitly need thumbnails (previews may include large base64 payloads).
